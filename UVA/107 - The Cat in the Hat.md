# 107 The Cat in the Hat (https://onlinejudge.org/external/1/107.pdf)

## problem simplified:
The problem is litte bit tricky. Let's try to understand it by an example. But before that you must read the statement. <br>
Let `N = 3`. Which means each cat will have 3 cats inside it. <br>
And let, `number of working cat = 9`. Then of the problem like the image below. Where `red` one is the initial cat. The `red` cat has `3` `green` cat inside it. Then each `green` cat has `3` `orange` cat inside them. <br>
It is given that heigt of the initail cat is `1`. So `orange` cat is of height `1`.

If you have any more confusion, you can look at this image below. This is a graph, and `h2` is the `initial cat` and `h0` are the `working cats`. <br>

From the question we can have an equation, that is 
            h = H / (N+1)
         => H = h * (N+1)  -----------(2)

working cat height h0 = 1 <br>
so using equation(2) h1 = h0 * (N+1) = 1 * (N+1) = (N+1)

likely-
            h2 = h1 * (N+1)
               = (N+1) * (N+1)
               = (N+1)^2
            h3 = (N+1)^3
            ...............
            ...............
            Hm = (N+1)^m  [Here m is the (depth_of_graph-1). for the given image avobe m = 2]   

So, we can say initial height, H = (N+1)^m -----------------(a)<br>
And, we can say number of working cat, WC = (N)^m -----------(b) <br>

taking log in both side of the equation (a) and (b)  we have - <br>

            log( (N+1)^m)/ log(N^m) = log(H) / log (WC)
         => log(N+1) / Log (N)  = log(H) / log (WC)
         => ( log(N) / Log (N+1) )* log(H) =  log (WC)  --------------(c)
Now we can `binary search` on equation (c), to find the value of N, as `H` and `WC` is given. <br>
Then we can find `m` using equation (a) or (b). <br>

Now we have the height of the tree(m+1) and how mane child each node have(N). So we can easily fing the  
number of cats that are not doing any work (cats of height greater than one) and also  the sum of all
the catsâ€™ heights.

*** This code is little bit tricky: CP is all about smat thinking and determination. ***



## observations
- You can't binary serach on integer in this case.
- If you give more time, you may find some O(n) solution of this problem.

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

        if (initial_hgt == 1){
            printf ("0 1\n"); continue;
        }
        if (working_cat == 1){
            lli x = 0, nwc;
            while (1){
                lli res = (1 << x) ;
                if (res > initial_hgt){
                    nwc = x - 1; break;

            while ( initial_hgt >= 1 ){
                H += initial_hgt;
                initial_hgt /= 2;
            }
            printf ("%lld %lld\n", nwc , H); continue;
        }

        // log N / log N+1 = log working_cat / log initial_hgt
        // (log N / log N+1) *  log initial_hgt = log working_cat

        long double l = 1, h = working_cat+1;
        long double mid;
        lli N = -1, m = -1;
        for(lli i=0; i<500; i++){
            mid = (l+h) / 2;
            long double x = (log(mid*1.0) / log(mid+1.0)) * log(initial_hgt*1.0);
            long double y = log(working_cat*1.0);
            if(x < y){

        m = 0;
        lli wc = working_cat;
        
        while(wc > 1){
            wc /= N;
            m++;
        }

        lli ht = 1, tot_cat  = 0, tot_ht = 0;
        for(lli i=m; i>=0; i--){
            lli cat = pow(N,i);
            tot_ht += cat * ht;
            ht *= (N+1);
            tot_cat += cat;
        }
        printf("%lld %lld\n",tot_cat-working_cat,tot_ht);
    }
